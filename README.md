# My Personal Landing Page / Portfolio

Welcome to my personal landing page â€“ a dynamic portfolio that showcases my work through engaging 3D visuals and interactive design. What started as a project based on a tutorial has evolved into a unique, customized experience that represents me and my skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**  
  The core library powering the interactive 3D graphics and animations on the page.

- **JavaScript (ES6)**  
  Utilized for creating dynamic behaviors and managing interactive elements throughout the site.

- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
  Employed for structuring the content and styling the visuals to achieve a modern, clean design.

- **WebGL**  
  Underlying technology that enables real-time 3D rendering in the browser via Three.js.

## Getting Started

To explore the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cenanionut/portofolio-threejs.git
   cd portofolio-threejs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   If the project utilizes a package manager, install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project:**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Then, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified) to view the landing page.

   > **Note:** If no build steps are defined (i.e., no package.json or bundler setup), you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## Background

Originally crafted as part of a tutorial, this project has since been transformed into my personal landing page. It now serves as an online portfolio, reflecting both my passion for creative web design and my expertise with modern web technologies.
